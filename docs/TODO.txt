TODO for A Typist's 65816 Assembler in Forth 
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
First version: 31. May 2015
This version: 08. Sep 2015

This is BETA software, so it needs more testing. A lot more testing. New features will be considered after some real-world experience with the assembler. 

- Add C/A synonyms ("TSA" for TSC) with warnings
- Warn if stack relative addressing with 0 is present ("0 lda.s") 
- Refactor a bunch of words that are just too ugly at the moment
