TODO for A Typist's 65816 Assembler in Forth 
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
First version: 31. May 2015
This version: 18. July 2015 

This is BETA software, so it needs more testing. A lot more testing. New features will be considered after some real-world experience with the assembler. 

- Add nag lines when synonyms such as PEI are used
- Warn if stack relative addressing with 0 is present ("0 lda.s") 
- Add check for range for future references of relative branches 
- Refactor a bunch of words that are just too ugly at the moment
