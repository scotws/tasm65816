Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
First version: 31. May 2015
This version: 19. Sep 2015

This is BETA software, so it needs more testing. A lot more testing. New features will be considered after some real-world experience with the assembler. 

PRIORITY

- Fix BRK so that single instruction does not throw an error


SECONDARY

- Add C/A synonyms ("TSA" for TSC) with warnings
- Add BLT as synonym for BCC, BGE for BCS 
  (see http://www.6502.org/tutorials/compare_beyond.html) 
- Warn if stack relative addressing with 0 is present ("0 lda.s") 


SOMETIME 

- Refactor a bunch of words that are just too ugly at the moment
