TODO for A Typist's 65816 Assembler in Forth

- See about included an "assert" command to make sure we have the correct mode for the A, X, and Y registers, maybe 

        A16 assert 
        XY8 assert 

  that will interrupt the assembly if it is not true. Something like: 

  : A16  mode.a 10 =  ; \ HEX assumed 
  : XY8  mode.xy 8 =  ; 
  : assert  invert if  ." Assert failed" ( PRINT BYTES) quit then ;
