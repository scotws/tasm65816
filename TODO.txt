This is ALPHA software, so not much works at this point, and less is tested. 

- Change code so that individual instructions can have more specialized functions, such as XCE checking to see if previous instruction was either CLC or SEC
- Get rid of various branching/jumping commands to future labels, and replace them by one generic version
